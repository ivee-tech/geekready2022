A couple of days tops, then it turns into a big dusty mush.\r\nAlthough there are still cold days in Winter, the temperature is not good enough to keep the snow.\r\nClimate change has transformed the seasons and Winter is no longer the season I used to enjoy as a child.\r\nOn top of that Summer season is way too hot, with much higher temperatures than I am used to.\r\nClimate change must be taken seriously, otherwise the entire planet will melt.\r\n",
