  "storyOriginalText": "In the 40s fifties. You can go down anytime and you know fill your bag up. We also had heaps of flounders. That you can go down there floundering all the time. My uncle's caught buckets. Which was shared out amongst the family.  \r\n\r\nThere we were able to get this up this round big round pipi’s. And this apparently there was only two places in New Zealand that had them so big like that. And it was one of them was out here. Across the railway line, not too many people in the Pa new. They were there because you know, living away from the sea. They never frequented as much as we did, but. We would go across. To the sea. When the tide was out across to the railway lines, we'd find mussels and oysters.  \r\n\r\nSeems like good. Woke Mom would mom would go there at certain tides and and my father. Getting shellfish pipi’s Boo boos. And got a bit older. Well, father. And uncles, we'd go there with our net. Certain tides. And yet always catch a feed and feed the Pa we used to go out.  \r\n\r\nWe used to go out with our togs on in the summer, come back with our pants full of cockles. Take your pants off, put them on the road to dry and have a feed a cockles.  \r\n\r\nAs far as I can remember, even when I was young as six. Bubbles who can go into school. The harbor was a playground for us. During the summer. \r\n\r\nThere was sandsharks and snapper used to come quite, you know, close. 'cause they fed on the pipi’s.  \r\n\r\nI was born here in 1940. And um. Most of my association with the with the foreshores when we were kids. Swimming, getting pipi’s,  \r\n\r\nand if they're not catching eels, they'll be catching flounders.  \r\n\r\nAlso got mussels. Which plentiful and sweet. The mussels are still there but you just can't eat them anymore, but they. Thriving I'll cut a couple open a few weeks ago and the smell was horrible.  \r\n\r\nThe kids, we all as kids used to go go down to the beach and sit on it. Go and get some pipi’s and and bring them out and sit on the on the side of the beach and and eat our pipi’s.  \r\n\r\nWe didn't buy fish and seafood often. It wasn't something we did. It was something we went and got.  \r\n\r\nMy life there was. Exciting for me. That because it was our playground out in the sea,  \r\n\r\nyou weren't allowed to leave a mess. You had to collect your shells and put them down. You know on the side of the beach. That's what our people used to make us do  \r\n\r\nMy grandfather was matua iwi Solomon. He was the matamua or the first born of all his Solomon brothers. And people used to think he was a bit mad going out there to get kai. They used to say he's you know it's polluted and you'll get sick and all this stuff in those days. What I remember probably when I was about 10 actually. Didn't stop him at all. And so from the time I was five, remember to when I. I left Takapuwahia in 1979 to go to boarding school and basically. Stayed out of the area from that that time on so. Up until 1979, yes, we had we had been fishing and and gathering kai in the harbor. All our lives. Even though not all of Ngati Toa thought it was safe to do so. Because of the pollution. From the Marae a little bit to the left there and there was a bus stop right there and straight out where the tide went out to the furtherest point we used to set the net straight out there and there and so my grandfather used to tell me how the how the fish ran in that and and all the signs to look for over there and and like for mullet for instance. There was a good night. There were certain night it was only once a month. One part of the month where we could fish for maybe a week. What I remember. And that was about the only time my grandfather. We know we'd have the net out there. So 3,45, nights consecutively and that would be our lot for that month.  \r\n\r\nWe used to go out with our with our aunties and together cockles and mussels. And. What we call Boo Boos which was periwinkles. They were more out in the in the sandy part. You know, the mud flats? And the water line in those days went right down to. The front of pak n save  \r\n\r\nthat drag and net and pulling a / 100 a 150 mullet. At a time. You know? Good sizes, you know.  \r\n\r\nIn the early days, mullet. You could see them, you know we went over there. They jump out of the water and. Everybody would not everybody who had a net who was home. We try and shoot down there, but that's. Over 50 years ago, I would say by the time I got to appreciate, I appreciate you know, fishing it all gone. The mullet anyway.  \r\n\r\nThe Onepoto Inlet area there was, it was significant for us because. It was always known that on on the Onepoto side were all a nice big fat juicy cockles and pipi’s. And because they were so big and so abundant. Our old people named that place nga karua tipuora. The eyes of tipu ora. Who was the niece of Te Rauparaha And that was known in ancient times. As nga korua tipuora because of the abundance of Pipi. And how big and significant they were. I mean that was huge. That way you could fit one on a saucer.\r\n",

      "redactedText": "In ******* *******. You can go down anytime and you know fill your bag up. We also had heaps of flounders. That you can go down there floundering all the time. My *****'s caught buckets. Which was shared out amongst the family.  \r\n\r\nThere we were able to get this up this round big round pipi’s. And this apparently there was only two places in New Zealand that had them so big like that. And it was one of them was out here. Across the railway line, not too many people in the Pa new. They were there because you know, living away from the sea. They never frequented as much as we did, but. We would go across. To the sea. When the tide was out across to the railway lines, we'd find mussels and oysters.  \r\n\r\nSeems like good. Woke *** would *** would go there at certain tides and and my ******. Getting shellfish pipi’s Boo boos. And got a bit older. Well, ******. And ******, we'd go there with our net. Certain tides. And yet always catch a feed and feed the ** we used to go out.  \r\n\r\nWe used to go out with our togs on in **********, come back with our pants full of cockles. Take your pants off, put them on the road to dry and have a feed a cockles.  \r\n\r\nAs far as I can remember, even when I was young as six. Bubbles who can go into school. The harbor was a playground for us. During **********. \r\n\r\nThere was sandsharks and snapper used to come quite, you know, close. 'cause they fed on the pipi’s.  \r\n\r\nI was born here in ****. And um. Most of my association with the with the foreshores when we were kids. Swimming, getting pipi’s,  \r\n\r\nand if they're not catching eels, they'll be catching flounders.  \r\n\r\nAlso got mussels. Which plentiful and sweet. The mussels are still there but you just can't eat them anymore, but they. Thriving I'll cut a couple open *************** and the smell was horrible.  \r\n\r\nThe kids, we all as kids used to go go down to the beach and sit on it. Go and get some pipi’s and and bring them out and sit on the on the side of the beach and and eat our pipi’s.  \r\n\r\nWe didn't buy fish and seafood often. It wasn't something we did. It was something we went and got.  \r\n\r\nMy life there was. Exciting for me. That because it was our playground out in the sea,  \r\n\r\nyou weren't allowed to leave a mess. You had to collect your shells and put them down. You know on the side of the beach. That's what our people used to make us do  \r\n\r\nMy *********** was ********* *******. He was the ******* or the first born of all his ******* ********. And people used to think he was a bit mad going out there to get ***. They used to say he's you know it's polluted and you'll get sick and all this stuff in those days. What I remember probably when I was about 10 actually. Didn't stop him at all. And so from the time I was five, remember to when I. I left Takapuwahia in **** to go to boarding school and basically. Stayed out of the area from that that time on so. Up **********, yes, we had we had been fishing and and gathering kai in the harbor. All our lives. Even though not all of ********* thought it was safe to do so. Because of the pollution. From the Marae a little bit to the left there and there was a bus stop right there and straight out where the tide went out to the furtherest point we used to set the net straight out there and there and so my *********** used to tell me how the how the fish ran in that and and all the signs to look for over there and and like for mullet for instance. There was a good night. There were certain ***** it was only ************. One part of ********* where we could fish for maybe ******. What I remember. And that was about the only time my ***********. We know we'd have the net out there. So 3,45, ****** consecutively and that would be our lot for **********.  \r\n\r\nWe used to go out with our with our ******* and together cockles and mussels. And. What we call ******** which was periwinkles. They were more out in the in the sandy part. You know, the mud flats? And the water line in those days went right down to. The front of pak n save  \r\n\r\nthat drag and net and pulling a / 100 a 150 mullet. At a time. You know? Good sizes, you know.  \r\n\r\nIn the early days, mullet. You could see them, you know we went over there. They jump out of the water and. Everybody would not everybody who had a net who was home. We try and shoot down there, but that's. Over ************, I would say by the time I got to appreciate, I appreciate you know, fishing it all gone. The mullet anyway.  \r\n\r\nThe Onepoto Inlet area there was, it was significant for us because. It was always known that on on the Onepoto side were all a nice big fat juicy cockles and pipi’s. And because they were so big and so abundant. Our old people named that place nga karua tipuora. The eyes of ********. Who was the ***** of ************ And that was known in ancient times. As nga korua tipuora because of the abundance of Pipi. And how big and significant they were. I mean that was huge. That way you could fit one on a saucer.\r\n"
