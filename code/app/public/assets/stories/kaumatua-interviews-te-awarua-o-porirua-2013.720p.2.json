So the environment changed and then changed because at that time they were short of houses so houses was the priority and so they just built wherever they could.  \r\n\r\nFor Porirua, do they call it the Spicer landfill?

      "redactedText": "Space we use for whatever activities we needed. We used to walk along there and Mr ******* used to train his horses along there as well. on the beach. And when that when they put that radio thing in there it more or less cut that out and when they put the radio mast in the Second World War and I think they put there in Titahi Bay those radio masks as a safeguard for possible invasion from whoever. And once I did that it changed the environment altogether.  \r\n\r\n**** the government. Decided they were going to put state housing. In this area, so they built a Causeway. From the Township of Porirua. Towards Titahi Bay and ends in Onepoto, But they put a straight line through our harbor and most of the stuff on the western side they filled in.  \r\n\r\nTrucks just turned up ******* *********** and start dumping rocks to form the foundation.  \r\n\r\nWatched that for ***********, You know getting higher and higher. And then a street was put in  \r\n\r\nThey, encroached upon our harbor. The bits that they filled in with the best Pipi grounds. The best Boo Boo grounds the little winkles which there were two species. Uhm? and the best places for floundering.  \r\n\r\nThe front of Pak n Save. You know, just across from Pak n Save on the footpath. There's a there's there's some silver balls on the footpath and that marks the water line. And ****************. ****************.  \r\n\r\nMost of up here is all ****. When I was a kid there, this this was all **** and we used to walk up here. Go up there up to the **** and walk through the Bush. Go over the hills and down to the sea on the other side. When when the ********* came here and they built all the houses up here and the government built all the houses here. So the environment changed and then changed because at that time they were short of houses so houses was the priority and so they just built wherever they could.  \r\n\r\nFor *******, do they call it the Spicer landfill? Everything from the landfill leeches into the Kenepuru stream, which comes down into Porirua in the harbor, and it doesn't make the harbor smell very nice at all. That that's another contaminant going in there.  \r\n\r\nI mean, I think one of the mistakes is personals was when they're not they made, was when they straightened the Kenepuru stream. And accelerated water and I instead I remember when they used to wind down from *********, all the debris would collect in each bend? So you could catch it. You could actually pull it out there.   \r\n\r\nThe stream absolutely rushes there near nothing to slow at the end. They've taken a lot of the species it used to live in the river away because they nowhere to settle nowhere to hide us just like our. Like a funnel? It was a good place to catch eels,  \r\n\r\nI guess in those days it was accepted that people could come in. Tip their wastes into the water. You know, but in these big truckloads used to come in, no, it wasn't rubbish. It wasn't like paint. Chemicals. Cause we would see, see the water oneday blue. You know the dyes.  \r\n\r\nGreen. Almost like slime screen wasn't slimy, but. It looked like that. And we went and tracked it down. And we told them ********************* where it came from and we expected them to do so. Nothing happened.  \r\n\r\nYou know, it's hard to give away something that you've been brought up on. You lived on you. You were fed from there and it was a hard thing to see it actually change. Yeah.  \r\n\r\nThe place was polluted and they put up signs it no. Shellfish is to be gathered from this area and the and the signs were, you know there was a about three or four down in this. On the side on the Titahi Bay **. Warning people later not to take their shellfish  \r\n\r\nAt their particular time. Closed what I think was, uh, a terrible chapter in terms of. That crown not meeting its obligation.  \r\n\r\nI'm involved with them ********. And I've seen our ******** break out in boils and. They've been sick. A lot of stomach complaints, part of the the their routine is to have tipping drills to learn how to how to steady their waka, how to cope and and in that situation. And so of course they get. Wet, And they get sick. So this. The the sea is not well, you know the the harbor. And so our people are not well as a result. Our **** love **** ama. But they're continuously getting getting ill. And breaking out and rashes and. Other complaints. As a result of the the seawater. I think. Someone came out and analyzed. The water and found that it did contain a lot of. **********.  \r\n\r\nBe nice if they could dredge it. It's gonna cost heaps, but you know. It took all those years too. Contaminate it it wouldn't take much. It just take a lot of money to fix it up,  \r\n\r\nyeah? Clean it up and if they can do the Thames, surely they can do the harbor.  \r\n\r\nIt's a nice seeing all the birds back on the water you know further down this way because there was a time when. you hardly saw many birds. *** there are many species of birds down on the water on that on those mud flats  \r\n\r\n"
