  "storyOriginalText": "  \r\n\r\nAs children, we used to walk along the beach because the water came where the main road is running now that was, that’s not there now That wasn't there either. The main road is is not there now because of the schools grounds are there, but that was we used to walk along there on the way to Porirua school used to play in the sea there, we used to fish in the sea there when we were kids we would go floundering in the night time  \r\n\r\nwe prepare the slipway every year so that would sort of last a few months. And we'd back a wooden boat down a clinker. And get that into the sea and and head on out to either. We would head to the reef. The main reef took toka a papa off Plimmerton. Or off the point, just off the point, and it seemed. Really deep water, but that's where Dad would choose to. Go for free dive for paua and kina. And he would often set a net off at the reef. And then come across and do a snorkel. And then we'd go back and bring the net back on our way back home.  \r\n\r\nThe fish used to be what the boys used to have to go out with our fathers and. And catch the fish. That was what we were. We were allowed to get. Was a shellfish, but when it came to getting. As aka said paua and kina we would have, they would go around to to Titahi Bay to get the that type of seafood for the. For the Hui’s that used to be on,  \r\n\r\nif we were going eeling across the railway line, there was just with the police college is now there was two big lagoons, and so we would go there when the tides out you can walk across where the where the river runs. It used to run out into the sea when it tides out you could walk across there, but when it tides in it was too deep. So when the tides out it told us we can walk across there so we would walk across there and that also told us that the lagoons were shallow. Then we'd go across there in Eeling, Eeling in there as well. Yeah, yeah. Gaffs and spears mostly.  \r\n\r\nInteresting enough, I bumped into a a photographer out here. By the name of Neil Penman. And he said that he’d just came from the harbor on a on a low low tide. And still captured some of the. Rings pipi rings that we used to make. What we had to do was get all the pipis that we could. Throw them inside these rock rings. So that we could go and get a kai or family could still get a kai when the tide was high or you'd feel around with your feet. For these rock rings and then just dig inside them. Or what I did manage to see and experience was when our manuhiri left. In some cases we go down and get a bag of pipi’s for them, and we'd find them quite easy if the tide was in. And put them in  their vehicles.  \r\n\r\nWe we had. counsel from our elderly people that when you go down and get kai food the kaimoana. Just take enough to feed your family and don't forget there's other people who want and need some as well.  \r\n\r\nLike a lot of our old people couldn't get out, so we went and got. Gave them some but not all the time, but just certain times when they wanted. If the message never got to us, we would.  \r\n\r\nWhere Whitireia is now just on the outside of Whitireia down where the sea comes up to Whitireia and right by with it with the the river runs out there this when it runs out there should be a big flat mud flats out there and So what we would do. We had car tyres and we put them down there on the mud flats and when the tide comes in they would cover them. They would cover the tires and the Congo eels would go into the tyres. It would just when the when the tide is out. We know when to get it. You don't go out when it's too late. You know, cause the eels would get out of the tires, so we used to go out there when we could. When we realized that it was not nice time to go and it would go out and pick the tires up and run the conga eels would be in the tires. Yeah, that's how we used to kiss them. We leave them in the tyres because we weren’t that game pulling, cause the conga eels would bite like mad.  \r\n\r\nWhen you caught them, you put them in there, put them in the sand, and then scraped the. Get a handful of sand and just scrape the slime off of. And. And then when you brought them home. You just put them in warm water and just get the rest off. And. I didn't need to gut it. In just fried it as as it was.  \r\n\r\nThe 1887 creation of the Porirua mental hospital the asylum. That became a huge component. In terms of. The first actual. Pollution by industrial waste. Both industrial and human waste. Was poured out into the Porirua into the Kenepuru stream. No, or very little dialogue without people here who are hunters and gatherers in. On this end of the hub. And it's at its peak. They would. They pushed out 150,000 gallons a day. Or if. So why that was occurring down there, We were still eating from the harbor up here and fishing and gathering.

      "redactedText": "  \r\n\r\nAs children, we used to walk along the beach because the water came where the main road is running *** that was, that’s not there *** That wasn't there either. The main road is is not there *** because of the schools grounds are there, but that was we used to walk along there on the way to Porirua school used to play in the sea there, we used to fish in the sea there when we were kids we would go floundering ************ time  \r\n\r\nwe prepare the slipway ********** so that would sort of *****************. And we'd back a wooden boat down a clinker. And get that into the sea and and head on out to either. We would head to the reef. The main reef took toka a papa off Plimmerton. Or off the point, just off the point, and it seemed. Really deep water, but that's where *** would choose to. Go for free dive for **** and ****. And he would often set a net off at the reef. And then come across and do a snorkel. And then we'd go back and bring the net back on our way back home.  \r\n\r\nThe fish used to be what the boys used to have to go out with our ******* and. And catch the fish. That was what we were. We were allowed to get. Was a shellfish, but when it came to getting. As aka said **** and **** we would have, they would go around to to Titahi Bay to get the that type of seafood for the. For the ***’s that used to be on,  \r\n\r\nif we were going eeling across the railway line, there was just with the police college is *** there was two big lagoons, and so we would go there when the tides out you can walk across where the where the river runs. It used to run out into the sea when it tides out you could walk across there, but when it tides in it was too deep. So when the tides out it told us we can walk across there so we would walk across there and that also told us that the lagoons were shallow. Then we'd go across there in Eeling, Eeling in there as well. Yeah, yeah. Gaffs and spears mostly.  \r\n\r\nInteresting enough, I bumped into a a ************ out here. By the name of ***********. And he said that he’d just came from the harbor on a on a low low tide. And still captured some of the. Rings pipi rings that we used to make. What we had to do was get all the pipis that we could. Throw them inside these rock rings. So that we could go and get a kai or family could still get a kai when the tide was high or you'd feel around with your feet. For these rock rings and then just dig inside them. Or what I did manage to see and experience was when our ******** left. In some cases we go down and get a bag of pipi’s for them, and we'd find them quite easy if the tide was in. And put them in  their vehicles.  \r\n\r\nWe we had. counsel from our elderly people that when you go down and get kai food the kaimoana. Just take enough to feed your family and don't forget there's other people who want and need some as well.  \r\n\r\nLike a lot of our old people couldn't get out, so we went and got. Gave them some but not all the time, but just certain times when they wanted. If the message never got to us, we would.  \r\n\r\nWhere Whitireia is *** just on the outside of Whitireia down where the sea comes up to Whitireia and right by with it with the the river runs out there this when it runs out there should be a big flat mud flats out there and So what we would do. We had car tyres and we put them down there on the mud flats and when the tide comes in they would cover them. They would cover the tires and the Congo eels would go into the tyres. It would just when the when the tide is out. We know when to get it. You don't go out when it's too late. You know, cause the eels would get out of the tires, so we used to go out there when we could. When we realized that it was not nice time to go and it would go out and pick the tires up and run the conga eels would be in the tires. Yeah, that's how we used to kiss them. We leave them in the tyres because we weren’t that game pulling, cause the conga eels would bite like mad.  \r\n\r\nWhen you caught them, you put them in there, put them in the sand, and then scraped the. Get a handful of sand and just scrape the slime off of. And. And then when you brought them home. You just put them in warm water and just get the rest off. And. I didn't need to gut it. In just fried it as as it was.  \r\n\r\nThe **** creation of the Porirua mental hospital the asylum. That became a huge component. In terms of. The first actual. Pollution by industrial waste. Both industrial and human waste. Was poured out into the Porirua into the Kenepuru stream. No, or very little dialogue without people here who are ******* and ********* in. On this end of the hub. And it's at its peak. They would. They pushed out 150,000 gallons *****. Or if. So why that was occurring down there, We were still eating from the harbor up here and fishing and gathering. You know, and very little dialogue, if any at all. Because I think the crown knew that we're in breach of that **** ***** land court decision.  \r\n"
